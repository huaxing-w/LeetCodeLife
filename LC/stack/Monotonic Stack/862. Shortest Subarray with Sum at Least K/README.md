a very good mono stack problem

also applys with the idea of greedy

ok  for the prefix sum array

if the new coming element is less than the last one, what happens?

the last one would not be the perfect candidate as the new coming element has bigger index and less value, which will make the future element - this one achieve a bigger value

similiar idea, at the front of the stack

if the coming element at back and the element at front are the okay pair, we dont need to consider the front one anymore, because the front one has bigger value, obviously it will meet the requirement, and it also bigger index, we want the smaller one
