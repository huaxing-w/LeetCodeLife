this is not a medium level question  
but a hard level question, the way of think sliding window is pretty diffcult   
first, you can not do binary search, and can not do typ sliding window  
then realize that there are only 26 letters in there   
so our first loop would be test for the max unique element in the window   
with this limit, we can do the our sliding window thing.
